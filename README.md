# 🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning
🚀 Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data, classifying tweets as positive, negative, or neutral using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It leverages Twitter API to fetch real-time tweets and applies various classifiers to determine sentiment.

📌 Features
✅ Real-time tweet analysis using the Twitter API
✅ Preprocessing pipeline: Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming
✅ Uses TF-IDF and word embeddings for text vectorization
✅ Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
✅ Deep learning support with LSTMs (optional)
✅ Data visualization: Word clouds, sentiment distribution graphs

🔧 Tech Stack
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
NLTK, SpaCy (for text preprocessing)
VADER, TextBlob (for sentiment scoring)
Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud (for visualization)
Tweepy (for Twitter API access)
